For this web application, I engaged GIPHY API to search for GIFs based on search criteria. 

Instructuions:
- Click from the selection of pre-defined buttons to search for GIFs.
- GIFs will show in the body the page, including their rating and can be played at the touch of a click.
- Users can create additional buttons using the submit form.

Created using: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, jQuery, GIPHY API
